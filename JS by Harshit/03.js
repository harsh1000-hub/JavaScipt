// Variables naming rules
/* 
1. Don't start with number use number in between or after varible name
2. Use underscore _ or $ dollar sign as a special symbol with variable name
3. Don't use space in between variable name
4. Use camelCase writing
*/
// Right approach to decalre a varible by following all rules
var firstName1 = "Mohit";
var _lastName = "Harsh";
console.log(firstName1);
console.log(_lastName);
