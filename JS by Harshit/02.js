// Variables in JS
"use strict";
// use strict enable us to do less error in JS syntax
var firstName = "Harsh";
console.log(firstName);
firstName = "Vaibhav";
console.log(firstName);

/* use case of "use strict";
firstName = "Harsh";
console.log(firstName);
firstname = "Vaibhav";
console.log(firstName);

1. In this case if we can't use var keyword for declare 
   variable so that firstName and firstname will two different
   varible and it can't give error and compile easily
